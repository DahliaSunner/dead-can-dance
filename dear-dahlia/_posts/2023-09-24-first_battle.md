Dear Dahlia,

Every time I feel the urge to write a message, I end up struggling to come up with anything coherent when the time comes to actually manifest whatever scattered thing is floating within my mind. It's as if there is no unity in my upper interior. I feel this weird negative force coming from the inside when I even think of writing you a message. ¿Might this be a sign? 
Despite ignoring if you even are a singular entity, doing this should do no harm at all. 
Regardless, I wish there was a way to confirm if these are reaching you, or at least some of you if that's something that's possible.
 
If you were multiple entities, ¿why would you go by «Dahlia»? ¿Are you a flower enthusiast cult or something?
I would like to get to know you more.

Songs of the day: 
Twenty One Pilots - Heathens (Orchestral Version)
Lemon Demon - Redesign Your Logo

Yours Truly,

truly yours
